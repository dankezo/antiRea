antiRea helps you audit what your website exposes, enforce server-side rate/pagination quotas, move critical logic to the server, and apply canary or watermark controls where appropriate. It **cannot** prevent users or agents from inspecting code delivered to their browser.

Install from npm:

```bash
npm install @dannyphan190/anti-rea
```

You can also install via [GitHub Release](https://github.com/dankezo/antiRea/releases).

## New in v2.1: Server Quota Guard, Normalized Canaries & Twin-SaaS Benchmark

We built **Northstar**, a synthetic SaaS app with dashboard, customer search, lead creation, CSV export, and chart views in both **baseline (`:4173`)** and **protected (`:4174`)** modes.

```bash
npm install
npm run build && npm run benchmark:build-sdk
python -m pip install playwright
python -m playwright install chromium firefox webkit
python benchmark/run_all.py --browsers chromium,firefox,webkit --iterations 5
```

To view the UI manually, open two terminals and run `npm run benchmark:baseline` alongside `npm run benchmark:demo`.

## What problem does antiRea address?

Tools like [morluto/rea](https://github.com/morluto/rea) assist in observing DOM structure, analyzing JavaScript bundles, tracing network traffic, and reconstructing web app UI.

The goal of this project is to help app owners implement **effective measures with minimal side effects**, backed by reproducible test benchmarks rather than security by obscurity.

## Four Tiers and Implementation Priority

| Priority | Feature | Expected Benefit | Limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0 - Foundation** | Server-side quota/pagination middleware (`createQuotaGuard`), per-record authorization, secret isolation | Core anti-scraping & anti-cloning guarantee | Cannot hide data already served to an authorized user |
| **Tier 1** | Hide public source maps (`verify-build.py` / `run-audit.cjs`); copyright notices; SVG/text provenance signatures | Prevents accidental full-source exposure | Easily stripped by determined users |
| **Tier 2** | Normalized API canary traps (`handleCanaryTrapRequest`) and low-confidence automation telemetry (`detectAutomationSignals`) | Logs abnormal probing for review | Not a blocking access control |
| **Tier 3** | AES-GCM context-bound envelopes (`encryptPayload` / `decryptPayload`) with bounded replay protection (`createInMemoryReplayGuard`) | Prevents simple cross-endpoint replay | Client still holds decryption context if key is in browser |
| **Tier 4** | Ephemeral token watermark overlay (`mountForensicWatermark`) | Traceability for leaked screen captures | Screen overlays can be cropped or edited out |

**Default Recommendation:** Implement P0 first, then set up Tier 1. For key APIs, enable server quotas and canary traps.

## Installation and Testing

Requires Node.js 20+. The repo has **no runtime dependencies**; TypeScript is a devDependency for building.

```bash
npm install
npm run check
npm run build
```

`npm run check` compiles, runs **38 automated tests**, and performs static checks. Scan your public build directory before deployment with `node scripts/run-audit.cjs /path/to/dist` or `python3 scripts/verify-build.py /path/to/dist`.

## How to Integrate the SDK

### 1. P0 Server-Side Quota & Pagination Guard (Recommended First)

```ts
import { createExpressQuotaMiddleware } from "@dannyphan190/anti-rea";

app.use("/api/", createExpressQuotaMiddleware({
  trustedIpHeader: "cf-connecting-ip",
  tiers: {
    anonymous: { maxRequests: 30, windowMs: 60_000, maxPageSize: 25, maxPage: 5 },
    free: { maxRequests: 60, windowMs: 60_000, maxPageSize: 50, maxPage: 20 },
    pro: { maxRequests: 300, windowMs: 60_000, maxPageSize: 200, maxPage: 100 },
  },
  resolveIdentity: req => ({
    accountId: req.headers.get("x-verified-account") ?? undefined, // populate from server auth middleware
    apiKeyId: req.headers.get("x-verified-key-id") ?? undefined,
    tier: "free",
  }),
  onQuotaExceeded: event => {
    console.warn("[quota-exceeded]", event);
  },
}));
```

Returns HTTP `429` with `Retry-After` when account, API key, or IP thresholds are exceeded, enforces `limit`/`pageSize` and `page`/`offset` bounds, and logs structured events for operators.

### 2. Server Canary Endpoints (with URL Canonicalization)

```ts
import { handleCanaryTrapRequest, normalizeCanaryPath } from "@dannyphan190/anti-rea";

const result = await handleCanaryTrapRequest(request, {
  onAlert: async event => { /* send sanitized event to your monitoring platform */ },
  resolveUserId: () => trustedServerSession.userId,
});
if (result.isTrapped) return Response.json(result.body, { status: result.status });
```

`normalizeCanaryPath` automatically canonicalizes trailing slashes, uppercase paths, and percent-encoded characters (`%2D`, `%5F`) so route variants cannot bypass exact matching.

### 3. Optional Watermark for Authenticated Previews

```ts
import { mountForensicWatermark } from "@dannyphan190/anti-rea";
const remove = mountForensicWatermark({ token: "A7fK3w9Z", enabled: true });
// Resolve that token to a session only in your private server ledger.
```

Do not embed the person's email, IP, or raw user ID in pixels. Provide a privacy notice and retention policy.

### 4. Advanced Envelopes: Server-Owned Keys & Bounded Replay Guard

```ts
import {
  createEnvelopeKey,
  encryptPayload,
   verifyTransportEnvelope,
  createInMemoryReplayGuard,
} from "@dannyphan190/anti-rea";

const key = await createEnvelopeKey();
const scope = { purpose: "report-export", method: "POST", path: "/api/export", sessionBinding: "trusted-session-id" };
const env = await encryptPayload({ result: "ok" }, key, scope);

// Automatically purges expired nonces by TTL and caps entries to prevent unbounded RAM growth
const replayGuard = createInMemoryReplayGuard({
  ttlMs: 300_000,
  maxEntries: 10_000,
});

const decoded = await verifyTransportEnvelope(env, key, scope, { markNonceOnce: replayGuard });
```

Use this pattern for independently controlled server services or carefully designed session protocols (use Redis `SET ... NX PX` in multi-instance clusters).

## Why not "block CDP" or inject malicious prompts?

The old `Error.stack` serialization trick was weakened by V8 changes; independent research documents the limitations of client-side blocking. DOM prompt injections are untrusted data, not a reliable or ethical security control. See [references](docs/REFERENCES.md).
